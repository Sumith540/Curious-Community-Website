## Project Overview: Curious Community
We are building a cutting-edge community website named Curious Community using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js) and Tailwind CSS for the frontend styling. The goal of Curious Community is to create a unique platform specifically designed for technology enthusiasts and developers. It will integrate the best features from social networks like LinkedIn, Instagram, and Facebook but tailor these features to serve the needs of a tech-focused audience.

4. Content Sharing (Inspired by Instagram):

### Visual content sharing such as coding snippets, design layouts, and infographics

### Community Engagement (Inspired by Facebook):
